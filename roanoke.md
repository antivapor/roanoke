Roanoke's Lost Pale Ale

A tasty treatise between English and American IPA's, this is our Roanoke's Lost Pale Ale recipe.

We used English style hops and English style grain but adjusted the recipe to have a very strong hoppy aroma and a astringent flaver akin to a American hophead.

##Recipe
* seven pounds of Muntons Amber Dried Malt Extract (color 18 EBC / Lovibond 7) (UK)
* one pound British crystal malt (UK)
* half'a pound malted barley, toasted 15 minutes at 350°F
* three ounces Northern Brewer hops, for boiling (13 HBU) (US)
* two ounces Cascade hops, one finishing, one for flavoring mid-boil (US)
* two vials of liquid ale yeast (35mL each), White Labs London Ale Yeast (WLP013 (first brew, both from lot 1013Ttb7747601))
* 1 cup of corn sugar, for bottling

###Brew Day
1. Put the toasted barley in a muslin cloth, and the pound of British crystal malt in another, and place in 1 1/2 gallons of cold water.
2. Bring this to a boil and remove the cloth bags with tongs. It is good to let the bags drip a good remainder into the mash, but do not overly squeeze the bags.
3. Add the seven pounds of Muntons, 3 ounces northern brewer, and boil for 30 minutes
4. Add one ounce of Cascade hops and keep boiling for another 30 minutes.
5. Add one ounce of Cascade hops, cover and turn off heat. Wait 3 min before sparging the wort.
6. Sparge the wort into cold water. Have filtered water pre-chilled onhand to bring your level up to the 5 gallon mark on your 5.5 gallon bucket.
7. If desired, place bags of ice into the bucket to hasten the temperature drop. Place the lid on lightly to protect against anything dropping into the mix.
8. When the temperature has dropped below 75°F add the two vials of London Ale Yeast.
9. Put your lid on and use a blowoff tube for at least the first couple days (36 to 48 hrs) before using a bubbler, if not the whole time.
10. In eight days from the brew day, it will be time to bottle! 

###Bottling Day
1. Take 1 cup of corn sugar and boil in 1/2 cup of water. Let cool, then add this to your mix, stir.
2. Aerate by pouring mixture from your bucket to another sanitized bucket, back and forth for four pours, and then let settle for 45 minutes.
3. Put the lid lightly back on so nothing falls in, and let sit, so the hops and yeast settle to the bottom.
4. After a half hour, it is time for bottling! When siphoning off the beer, go ahead and get everything right down to the dregs. Roanoke doesn't believe in clarity (or a second fermentation)!

###Drinking Day
Seven days after you bottled, it is time to harvest. Drink to your taste, pour into a mug or chilled pint glass. If you brewed exactingly, there is going to be some yeasties at the bottom of your bottle, feel free to save for an iterative batch.
